The Game of LIfe is a grid of square cells, which either have a state of dead or alive. Each cell interacts with its eight neighbours. at each step one of the following transitions occur:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Implementation:
The Conways Game of Life code is implemented using Python and the GUI using Pygame.

Usage:

Mouse click to toggle the cell state. 
Press enter to produce the next generation
